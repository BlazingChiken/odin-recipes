        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>The recipe includes plain yogurt and bananas, so the result will be a soft muffin with great moisture. Banana muffins taste similar to banana bread—and very ripe bananas, like banana bread, will work best for this recipe.</p>
        <p>This recipe is very easy to make: Just combine your dry ingredients and your wet ingredients separately, then stir together until combined. Then, you’ll fold in the bananas and chocolate chips, portion into muffin tins, and let your oven do the rest of the work.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup mashed ripe bananas</li>
            <li>¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. </li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix oil, yogurt, egg, and vanilla together in a separate bowl until well combined; stir into flour mixture until smooth. Gently fold in mashed bananas and chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 22 to 25 minutes. Cool briefly in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
